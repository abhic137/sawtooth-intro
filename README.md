# sawtooth-intro
Sawtooth in blockchain is a modular and flexible platform for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers (also called blockchains). It is part of the Hyperledger project, which is an open source initiative to develop blockchain technologies for business use.

Sawtooth is designed to be scalable and secure, and it supports a variety of features that make it suitable for enterprise applications. For example, Sawtooth supports multiple consensus algorithms, including PBFT and PoET. This allows businesses to choose the consensus algorithm that best meets their needs.

Sawtooth also supports parallel transaction processing, which can improve the performance of blockchain applications. Additionally, Sawtooth is modularly designed, which makes it easy to add new features and capabilities.

Here are some of the key features of Sawtooth in blockchain:

    Modular design: Sawtooth is designed to be modular, which makes it easy to add new features and capabilities.
    Scalability: Sawtooth is designed to be scalable to handle large volumes of transactions.
    Security: Sawtooth uses a variety of security features to protect the blockchain from attack.
    Flexibility: Sawtooth supports a variety of features and capabilities, making it suitable for a wide range of enterprise applications.

Here are some examples of how Sawtooth can be used in blockchain applications:

    Supply chain management: Sawtooth can be used to track the movement of goods through a supply chain, from raw materials to finished products. This can help to improve transparency and efficiency in the supply chain.
    Trade finance: Sawtooth can be used to facilitate trade finance transactions, such as letters of credit and invoices. This can help to reduce risk and improve efficiency in the trade finance process.
    Healthcare: Sawtooth can be used to store and manage patient medical records. This can help to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare services.

Sawtooth is a powerful and flexible blockchain platform that can be used for a wide range of enterprise applications. It is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way that businesses operate.
